## Supported Browsers

Packages in this repository are designed to work with the following browsers

- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Mozilla Firefox

### Internet Explorer Support

Active support for Internet Explorer was dropped in August 2021. As of 04/2021 we no longer output CommonJS and instead output ESM. We also do not provide any polyfills. These will need to be configured in your own environment.

You must use an older version of the package if you still need support for IE 11.

TODO: get list of ie supported versions
