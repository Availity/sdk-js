This library resolves relative IRIs to absolute IRIs given a base IRI, conforming to [RFC3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt). The code was borrowed from [relative-to-absolute-iri
](https://github.com/rubensorks/relative-to-absolute-iri.js). ~There is an open issue to make the library compatible with IE11: [Issue #5](https://github.com/rubensworks/relative-to-absolute-iri.js/issues/5)~
